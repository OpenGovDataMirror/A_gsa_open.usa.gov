Chief Executive Officer  
Open Government Partnership  
1110 Vermont Avenue NW, Suite 500  

Dear Dr. Pradhan:

**Re: United States National Action Plan â€” Delayed**

With this letter, the United States Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer notifies the Open Government Partnership that the publication of the fourth National Action Plan and related documents will be delayed until early 2018.

This delay will allow the additional time needed to fine tune a strong and quality action plan reflective of national priorities.

Thank you for your continued flexibility as we continue working with our trusted civil society partners and the Open Government Partnership.

Sincerely,

Margie Graves  
Acting Federal Chief Information Officer  
Office of Management and Budget  
Executive Office of the President
