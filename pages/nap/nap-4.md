### Guidance for Commitments
We look forward to your valuable contributions as we co-create the United States’ fourth National Action Plan (NAP 4). 

This year marks an important transition for U.S. commitments to open government, as we move towards a smaller set of targeted, impactful and elevated commitments from broader sets of initiatives that have characterized past NAPs. 

In light of our goal, we encourage our civil society and Federal agency partners to work closely together to:

* Identify and deepen initiatives that are working and you want to see more of in the NAP 4;
* Develop meaningful and ambitious commitments for the NAP 4 that reflect a spirit of clear accountability to U.S. citizens and demonstrate American leadership in promoting transparency and good governance.

**The NAP 4 will cover the two year period between September 1, 2018 and August 31, 2020. All commitments should be:**

* Achievable within this timeframe;
* Ambitious and measureable per the template below;

**Commitment Template:**

> **Suggested Title**
> 
> **Topline Description** - *One sentence “elevator pitch”*
> 
> **Key Objective(s)** - *Describe how this initiative creates a more transparent, participatory, or collaborative government*
> 
> **Paragraph Description** - *For examples, please review paragraphs from past National Action Plan commitments (see [https://open.usa.gov](https://open.usa.gov))*

**Ensuring Metrics are Measurable:**

* *Ensure we can quantify, verify, monitor, and report progress*
* *Provide timelines when possible as work should be completed by August 2020*
 
You can find all submitted commitments, goals, and feedback [on GitHub](https://github.com/GSA/participate-nap4/issues).
